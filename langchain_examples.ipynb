This may involve finding efficiencies within government operations, increasing revenue through economic growth initiatives, or potentially implementing targeted tax increases on those who can afford it. Ultimately, it is our duty to prioritize the well-being and livelihoods of those who serve our communities, and we will work tirelessly to find the necessary funding to support their salary increases.'"
